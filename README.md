### What I learned

- Deepened understanding of Semantic HTML markup: I am a huge proponent of information being accessible, so I have taken to really learning about semantic HTML. I spent a good amount of time on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines website checking for ways in which I should write up each componenet.

- Understanding and creating a CSS Reset: A solid CSS reset reduces inconsistencies between different browsers by giving the page it's own defaults for various aspects of the page. I learned a lot about margins, line heights, and font sizes with while creating mine.

- How to add icons with the data attribute: The shopping cart is an icon, and those are small images that aren't necessary in the layout of the page. Originally, I put in a span, but decided to go with a custom data-\* attribute to keep it out of the site layout.

- Pseudo-classes and functional pseudo-classes: I learned a good bit about action and functional pseudo classes - of course I've used :hover before, but I never really knew what it was technically called. I am not a fan of cumbersome code, and wanted to write my code for :hover, and :focus at the same time - which led me to the is() functional pseudo-class.

### Continued development

I definitely want to continue learning about WCAG and really perfecting my semantic HTML skills so I can develop web apps that aren't just beautiful, but also accessible to as many people as possible.

I also want to really perfect flexbox and grid. I know that intuition is honed through praxis, so I am interested in further honing my skills with it.

### Useful resources

- WCAG Docs (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/) - This helped me get my line spacing baseline for my CSS reset. I'm keeping this as a resource in order to keep everything I create accessible to as many as possible.
- MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I searched this repeatedly! This has quickly become the most used site, it has all the information I need in one easy to find spot. I will say that the language is definitely geared towards someone who is at least slightly versed in developer jargon, but it's still completely approachable material for newbies like me.
- W3 School (https://www.w3schools.org) - I would follow a query on MDN Docs with a similar search here. The MDN was good

I definitely have to give props to Kevin Powell (https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell). His videos really helped me understand a lot of concepts that I was still hazy on.
